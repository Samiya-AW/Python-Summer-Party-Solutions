# Python Summer Party Notebooks  

This repository showcases my completed notebooks from the Interview Masterâ€™s Python Summer Party challenge. It's designed for recruiters, peers, and learners to explore my approach to solving data analysis problems using pandas and numpy.

## Key Highlights:
- Daily problem-solving with pandas, numpy, and Python's standard libraries
- Practical challenges that mimic data analyst tasks across various industries
- Emphasis on data quality, feature engineering, and deriving business insights

## How to Use:
1. Create and activate a Python environment (either venv or conda).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab pandas numpy
   ````

3. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook and open any `day-XX.ipynb` file.
